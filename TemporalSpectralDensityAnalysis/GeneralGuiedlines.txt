The Following analysis paradigms are focused on creating TSE/ERSP maps. 
please include all folders in your matlab environment 

in OneCondition folder 
You should modify the file called OneConditionExtractTSEForAllCH
Given that you have cleaned epoched data from different subjects this script will provide you with 
A figure for each subject x electrode showing their TSE / ERSP 
An Average TSE/ERSP figure per electrode 
a STD TSE/ERSP figure per electrode

In TwoCondtiions folder 
You should modify the file called TwoConditionsExtractTSEForAllCH
Given that you have cleaned epoched data from different subjects this script will provide you with 
A figure for each subject x electrode x condition showing their TSE / ERSP 
An Average TSE/ERSP figure per electrode per condition 
a STD TSE/ERSP figure per electrode per condition 
a Wilcoxon Ranked-sum test Map per electrode showcasing where the two conditions differes from each other significantly.

In the FigureHelperScripts 
You find the script which modifies all the figures to look as they do. 
you are free to modify this file as you pleae.

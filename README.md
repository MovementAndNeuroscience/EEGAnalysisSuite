# EEGAnalysisSuite
This is the EEG Analysis Suite used at the section for Moevment And Neuroscience. This will encompase -  Power Spectral Density Analysis, - Event-Related Potential analysis,  - Correlation Analysis,  - Time Spectral Density Analsis, 

To run the Analysis Suite EEGLab is a prerequisite

During time the folder will be populated with different scripts. 

The GitHub Contains different folders
BasicInfo 
MeanCalculations 
Projects
Topoplots

## BasicInfo
This folder contains scripts to perfrom basic information extraction. 
such as number of electrodes, files, and sorting the subjects into groups

## MeanCalculations 
These are scripts to calculate means of different frequency ranges dependent on different variables

## Projects 
This folder contains different projects and their figure results based on the scxripts found in the other folders. 
The scripts in these folders calls different other scripts and provides an overview of how to use them.

## Topoplots
These scripts contructs and save topoplots based on different permutation of data

## Table
These creates and saves tables for matlab and excel to dissect.

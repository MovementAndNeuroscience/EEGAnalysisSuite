Through the scripts many automatic steps 
is tacken to preprocess the files. 
However, there is a number of actions 
which you have to do yourself. 

1. run triggersAndLocationGtecEEGdata.m
this will load in the g.tecx formatted data
tell it which channel includes triggers. 
extract unwanted channels and add location 
information. 
(this script is only viable for g.tec data, this means for any other EEG
data this script should be changed)

2. run filteringEEG.m
this will apply 
High-pass - 0.5
Low-pass - 100
Notch 48-52
Extract only art data with 5 sec rest 
(triggers 1-40, 5sec before and 40 sec after)

3. manually inspect the channels 
interpolate or remove bad channels depends 
on the result 

4. run Reference_ICA.m 
this will re-reference the signal the average
of the channels, thus make it comparable 
to other studies. Then the script will run 
ICA analysis. 

5. manually remove bad ICA Components using
the plugin MARA as a help to identify bad ICs
or visually inspect it. 

6. run EpochEEG.m
This will epoch the data and remove non epoch
related data from the dataset. 

7. run SeperateConditions.m 
this script will create and save the number 
of conditions you have in your dataset. 
now it is into two conditions. However it can 
be into as many as you want, simply just 
edit the file.
